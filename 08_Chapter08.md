As the ruins of the Bane of Mordor collapsed, Frodo found himself trapped in a world of darkness. His heart yearned for the peace and tranquility that he could never return to. However, his journey in this new world had only just begun.

And so it was that Frodo found himself at the edge of a great abyss, staring into the eternal emptiness that lay ahead. It was here that he met a special guest, the legendary Gollum.

The creature had long since abandoned his lust for the Ring, and instead had found solace in these dark and perilous lands. He had seen the rise and fall of empires, witnessed the majesty of the Gods, and had now chosen to reside in the bowels of a world that no longer needed him.

But Gollum was not the only predator lurking in the shadows. The armies of Sauron, now led by the Undead, were hot on Frodo's heels. Their dark magic had grown strong over the ages and they no longer suffered from the weaknesses of men. 

As the armies of the Undead closed in on Frodo, he knew that he could not fight alone. With Gollum by his side, he summoned his allies, the Valar, the mightiest of the Gods, and their legions of warriors descended into the abyss.

A great battle, the likes of which had never been seen before, ensued. The Valar and the Undead clashed, the very skies shuddering from the force of their blows. 

The Valar and Frodo emerged victorious, but at a great cost. Gollum had given his life in the battle, taking down a large contingent of the Undead with him. Frodo would always remember the twisted creature who had led him to the Ring, and how he had ultimately redeemed himself in death, fighting for his newfound friends until his final breath.
The darkness loomed over Frodo and he felt the weight of loneliness and despair press down upon his spirit. The once busy hub of Mordor was once again empty, and he could hear nothing but his own ragged breaths as he tried to navigate his way through the ruins.

As he stumbled into one chamber, he saw Gollum sitting in a corner, wrapped in his own contemplation. Without a word, Frodo sat down beside him.

"You know what it's like to be all alone," Gollum said finally. "You know the way each night drags out like an endless nightmare, the way your thoughts can turn on themselves until they're a hungry beast that gnaws itself raw."

Frodo nodded, and Gollum continued. "I used to think that the Ring would bring me peace, but now I see that it brought me nothing but pain. I can only hope that I can redeem myself in the end."

The two men sat in silence for a few moments longer until the sound of footsteps echoed through the chamber. The Undead had arrived.

Frodo and Gollum fought fiercely against their enemies, but the darkness was too powerful to conquer. The Undead army seemed to be an army of endless warriors, and Frodo and Gollum both understood that their end was near.

It was then that the Valar, the mightiest of the Gods, arrived. They fought a great battle against the Undead army, their blows so strong that the very earth shook with the impact. Frodo watched as the power of the Valar pushed back the darkness and the undead army was defeated.

As the battle ended, Frodo and Gollum were alone once more. Gollum, mortally wounded in the conflict, passed away in Frodo's arms, his redemption complete.

Frodo felt a weight lift off his shoulders as he watched Gollum's soul ascend to the afterlife. The Valar had come to his aid, and with their help, the darkness had been pushed back. He knew that he could never forget the sacrifice of Gollum and the victory of the Valar. With a sense of renewed purpose and gratitude, he continued his journey.
Frodo had passed through many trials by the time he found himself at the edge of that dark abyss. Through the kindness of strangers and the grace of the divine, he had overcome insurmountable odds and fought back the darkness that threatened to swallow him whole. 

By the power of the Valar and the sacrifice of Gollum, Frodo had triumphed over the armies of the Undead, and the darkness that had once been all-consuming was now just a memory. Though he still yearned for the peace of the undying lands, Frodo could now look back on his journey with pride, knowing that he had given everything to ensure that the darkness would never win.

As he looked out at the world beyond the abyss, he took a deep breath and set out with renewed determination. Though the road ahead of him would be long, Frodo knew that with a steadfast spirit, the help of mighty allies, and the memories of those who had passed, he could conquer every challenge that lay ahead.
