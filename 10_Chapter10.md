# Chapter 7 - The Rise of the Dead King

The lingering echoes of battle still hung heavy in the air as the Undead Warrior Kings seethed with restless energy, locked in deathly combat. Frodo, meanwhile, had been plucked from the fray and was now on his way to the undying lands, in a journey that would ultimately change the course of Middle-earth. Yet even as Frodo set sail, a sinister force was stirring in the darkness, waiting to unleash its wrath upon the living.

Atop a desolate mountain peak stood the ancient fortress of Angmar, home to the malevolent Necromancer, who had long lain dormant. But now, with the whispered commands of Sauron still ringing in his ears, the Necromancer had been reawakened, his power swelling with each passing moment. From the depths of the earth, he summoned forth a horde of undead soldiers, their eyes glowing with an unholy light.

As the ranks of the dead swelled, the Necromancer donned his crown and became the Dead King, his gaze fixed on the sprawling lands of Middle-earth, and the living that dwelt there. With a wave of his bony hand, he summoned his minions to him, and the ground itself trembled beneath their feet.

As the Dead King prepared to unleash his wrath upon the realm of the living, a desperate race against time began. The armies of the living scrambled to prepare for battle, as the fate of Middle-earth hung in the balance. But even as they prepared for war, a small band of heroes vowed to strike at the heart of the enemy itself, to pierce the veil of death and strike down the Necromancer, once and for all.
# Chapter 7 - The Rise of the Dead King: The Tale of The Undead and The Necromancer

In the shadow of the great mountain of Angmar, a lone figure slunk through the mist, his gaunt frame draped in tattered robes. He was the Necromancer, once a mortal man whose boundless lust for power had plunged him into the abyssal depths of corruption and evil. Now, he ruled over the undead with an iron fist, his will commanding legions of soulless soldiers who had long been severed from life.

His plan was to storm the gates of the divine, to trample the realms of the living beneath his feet, and to rend the fabric of existence so that he might reign supreme even over the gods of old. To do so, he needed an army; and in the murky depths of the underworld, he had found one.

The Undead Warrior Kings hearkened to his summons, their unholy spirits rising from the dust to serve their new master. They had seen many battles in life, and had emerged triumphant time and again, but nothing had prepared them for the fearsome spectacle of the Necromancer's glory. Even as they marched beneath his banner, they felt their hearts swell with equal parts terror and awe.

Yet within their ranks was a warrior more skilled and more fearless than any other. His name was Thorondor, and he had been born to fight the undead. When the call came to answer the Necromancer's summon, he had hesitated, for he feared the power of the dead. But even more than that, he had feared the prospect of the Necromancer's growing army.

So, Thorondor went to the mountain of Angmar, armed with sword and shield, ready to confront the Necromancer and his undead legions. The Necromancer was waiting for him, his eyes glittering with a malevolent light under the hood of his cloak.

But Thorondor was not afraid. With a fierce battle cry, he charged into the throng of the undead, his blade glowing white-hot in the dim light. One by one, the undead fell before him, their gory limbs littering the ground. The Necromancer himself remained untouched, writhing with fury as Thorondor hacked and slashed his way towards him.

And then, with a mighty surge of power, the Necromancer launched himself at Thorondor, his skeletal fingers reaching out to claim his foe's throat. But the skilled warrior knew of the Necromancer's touch, and he raised his shield in a last-minute defense. A burst of energy sent Thorondor flying backward, but he recovered quickly, rising to meet his foe once again.

The Necromancer summoned more undead to the fray, but they were no match for Thorondor's blade. Again and again, he struck, his prowess honed through years of practice and discipline. The undead crumbled before him, and the Necromancer howled in frustration.

In that moment, Thorondor struck, his sword piercing the Necromancer's skin. The evil ruler fell, crumpling to the ground, his power spent. The undead, free from his control, scattered to the winds, their spirits returning to the underworld.

With the Necromancer dead, Middle-earth was saved, and the living breathed a sigh of relief. Yet even as the celebrations began, Thorondor knew that the threat of the undead could never truly go away; that in the shadows, the Necromancer's corrupt influence would continue to seep into the world. But for now, at least, the Undead Warrior Kings had been defeated- and Middle-earth could rest for a little while longer.
The defeat of the Undead Warrior Kings and the death of the Necromancer had come at a great cost to many of the living inhabitants of Middle-earth. Yet, the heroic actions of Thorondor had ensured that the Necromancer's insidious plan would never come to fruition. For a time, there would be peace, but the shadow of the Necromancer would always loom large in the hearts and minds of Middle-earth's people. Such is the burden of living in a world constantly assailed by evil.

Thorondor, forever changed by his battle with the Undead Warrior Kings, took solace in knowing that, through his actions, the future of Middle-earth had been saved. As he looked out over the peaceful lands, he knew that he would always be ready to fight against the forces of darkness, should they ever rise again.

The fate of Middle-earth hung in the balance once again, but those who remained, both living and dead, would never forget the sacrifices made for their freedom.
