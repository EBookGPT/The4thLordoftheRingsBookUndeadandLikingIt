As the journey of the fourth book in the Lord of the Rings series begins, a quick recap is in order. The story of Frodo, Aragorn, Gandalf, and their companions has been a tale of epic proportions, filled with adventure, heartbreak, and hope.

The first book, The Fellowship of the Ring, saw Frodo forced to leave his peaceful life in the Shire and embark on a perilous journey to destroy the One Ring, which had been forged by the evil Sauron. Along the way, he was joined by a fellowship of brave warriors, including Aragorn, Gimli, Legolas, and Boromir.

The second book, The Two Towers, saw Frodo and his faithful companion Sam make their way towards Mordor, as the rest of the fellowship fought battles against Sauron's armies. Meanwhile, Gandalf returned from the dead to aid in the fight against evil.

The third book, The Return of the King, saw Frodo and Sam finally reach the heart of Mordor, where they were met by Gollum, who had been following them for some time. In a desperate struggle, Gollum tried to take the Ring from Frodo, but in the end fell into the heart of Mount Doom, destroying both himself and the Ring.

Now, with the fourth book, Undead and Liking It, the focus turns to Frodo and his life after the destruction of the Ring. It is a time of great change and uncertainty, as Frodo tries to find his place in a world without the guiding mission that has occupied him for so many years. But as always, he is not alone, and with the help of his friends, he will find a way forward.
In the days of old, when gods and monsters still roamed the earth, there lived a hobbit named Frodo. He was a gentle creature, content with his life in the green fields and quiet woods of the Shire. But fate had other plans for him, and soon he would find himself embroiled in a conflict that would shake the very foundations of the world.

It began with the forging of the One Ring, a powerful artifact crafted by the dark lord Sauron in order to dominate all other beings. But the Ring was lost, and Sauron spent many years searching for it, until it finally fell into the hands of Frodo's uncle, Bilbo.

Bilbo passed the Ring on to Frodo, but the hobbit soon discovered that its power was too great for him to resist. He was joined on his journey by a fellowship of brave warriors, each with their own special skills and gifts. Together, they set out to destroy the Ring in the fires of Mount Doom, where it had been forged long ago.

Their journey was fraught with danger, as they faced obstacles and enemies of all kinds. They fought battles against orcs and trolls, encountered giant spiders and treacherous dark wizards, and endured hardships of every sort. And all the while, Frodo felt the weight of the Ring upon him, its evil presence gnawing at his mind and soul.

In the end, it was Frodo and his faithful companion Sam who carried the Ring to Mount Doom. There, in the heart of the burning mountain, they confronted the creature Gollum, who had once possessed the Ring himself. In a final struggle, Gollum fell to his death, taking the Ring with him.

The destruction of the Ring brought an end to Sauron's reign of terror, and Frodo was hailed as a hero. But the journey had taken a toll on him, and he was never the same again. Now, as he begins a new chapter in his life, he must discover what it means to live in a world without the Ring, and learn to find joy and purpose in the simple pleasures of life.
Thus, the story of Frodo and the Ring comes to a close in the third book of The Lord of the Rings. Yet as we embark on the journey of the fourth book, we are left with the question of what comes next for Frodo, and how he will navigate a new world without the guiding mission that has consumed him for so long. The recap of the events leading up to the start of the 4th book serves as a reminder of the epic nature of Frodo's journey to destroy the Ring, and underscores the weight of the burden he carried. But as we move forward, we have hope that Frodo will find a way to move beyond his past and embrace the possibilities of a new beginning, as he faces the challenges and adventures that await him in the Undying Lands.
